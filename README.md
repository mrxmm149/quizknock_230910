Code for solving "Make10"-like puzzles.

Reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4mh9qsH0Zhs

Outline:
- run_nums: first method, does [current value] [operation] [next value]
- run_nums_2: second method, does operations in "elimination tournament" format.
- Basically I made the same mistake Dr. Tsurusaki made in the video.

TODO:
- Better output format. Currently this code requires human interpretation of the output.
- Make test cases (from the video?)
- Somehow combine two functions into one.
